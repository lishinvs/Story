PROLOGUE

Alicia Berensen's Diary

14th July

I don't know why I'm writing this.
    That's not true. Maybe I do know, and just don't want to admit it to myself.
    I don't even know what to call it - this thing I'm writing. It feels a little pretentious to call it a diary. It's not like I have anything to say. Anne Frank kept a diary, or Samuel Pepys - not someone like me. Calling it a 'journal' sounds too academic, somehow. As if I should write in it every day, and I don't want to - if it becomes a chore, I'll never keep it up.
